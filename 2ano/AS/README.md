# LECI - Systems Analysis

## Objectives

In this course unit I became familiar with the disciplines of systems analysis, modeling, and design within the context of software engineering.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course unit, I was able to:

- **Compare the main software development processes and explain the underlying practices.**
- **Perform analysis and specification of software system requirements and participate critically in their validation.**
- **Document functional and non-functional requirements in a specification.**
- **Apply specification approaches using scenarios (e.g., use cases).**
