# LECI - Compilers

## Objectives

This course addresses language theory with the aim of equipping me with the ability to design and implement syntax-directed translators, focusing on compiler construction. By the end of the course, I have acquired:

- The ability to work with regular languages, including the manipulation of computational models used to describe and recognize them, such as regular expressions, finite automata, and regular grammars.
- The ability to work with context-free languages, both in their interpretation and design.
- The ability to distinguish between lexical analysis and syntactic analysis.
- The ability to effectively use ANTLR4 to design and implement syntax-directed translators, including compilers.
